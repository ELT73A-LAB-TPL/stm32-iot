# n8n Host and Protocol
# Change N8N_HOST to your domain if you are using a reverse proxy for public access.
# If not using a reverse proxy, keep it as localhost.
N8N_HOST=localhost 
# Set N8N_PROTOCOL to 'https' if you are using a reverse proxy with SSL, otherwise 'http'.
N8N_PROTOCOL=http 

# PostgreSQL Database Credentials
# These are used by the n8n service to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
# IMPORTANT: Change these to strong, unique passwords!
POSTGRES_DB=n8n
POSTGRES_USER=n8nuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=n8npassword

# n8n Basic Authentication Credentials
# These protect your n8n UI. Enable N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE in docker-compose.yml
# and set these to strong, unique credentials.
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin

# Timezone for n8n
# This is crucial for correct scheduling and timestamp handling in n8n.
# Find your nearest timezone in the IANA Time Zone Database (e.g., "America/New_York", "Europe/Berlin", "Asia/Tokyo").
# Current location inferred as Curitiba, Brazil.
TZ=America/Sao_Paulo 

# N8N Encryption Key (Optional but Recommended for Production)
# This key is used to encrypt sensitive data (like credentials) stored in n8n's database.
# If you set this, n8n will encrypt credentials in the database.
# Generate a long, random string (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`).
# IMPORTANT: DO NOT LOSE THIS KEY! Losing it means you lose access to encrypted credentials.
