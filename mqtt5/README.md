To test your **STM32-MQTT** Docker Compose setup, you'll need an **MQTT client** to publish messages to and subscribe from your Mosquitto broker.

First, ensure your Docker Compose services are running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can verify that the `mqtt5` container is running by:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see `mqtt5` listed with a `Status` of `Up`.

### 1. Using Mosquitto Command-Line Clients (`mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub`)

These tools are usually part of the Mosquitto package on your host machine. If you don't have them, you might need to install `mosquitto-clients` (e.g., `sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients` on Debian/Ubuntu, or Homebrew on macOS).

Alternatively, you can run them from *within* your Mosquitto Docker container, which ensures you have the correct versions and avoids local installation:

**a) Subscribe to a topic:**

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
docker exec -it mqtt5 mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "test/topic" -q 1
```

This terminal will now wait for messages on `"test/topic"`.

**b) Publish a message:**

Open *another* new terminal and run:

```bash
docker exec -it mqtt5 mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "test/topic" -m "Hello from Docker!" -q 1
```

After running the `mosquitto_pub` command, you should see "Hello from Docker!" appear in the terminal where you ran `mosquitto_sub`. This confirms your broker is receiving and forwarding messages.

### 2. Using a Desktop MQTT Client (Recommended for GUI)

Graphical MQTT clients offer a much more user-friendly interface for testing. Popular options include:

* **MQTT Explorer:** Highly recommended for its intuitive UI, topic visualization, and ease of use.
* **MQTTX:** Another excellent cross-platform client with good features.

**Steps for a Desktop Client (general):**

1.  **Download and Install:** Get your preferred MQTT client from its official website.
2.  **Create a New Connection:**
    * **Host:** `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) â€“ This refers to your host machine, which Docker is mapping ports to.
    * **Port:** `1883` (for standard MQTT)
    * **Port:** `9001` (for MQTT over WebSockets, if your client supports it and you want to test that)
    * **Client ID:** (Optional) A unique identifier for your client.
    * **Username/Password:** (Optional, if you configured authentication in `mosquitto.conf`)
3.  **Connect:** Establish the connection.
4.  **Subscribe:** Add a new subscription, e.g., to topic `test/topic` or `sensor/#` (using wildcards).
5.  **Publish:** Send a message to a topic, e.g., `test/topic` with a payload like "Hello from MQTT Explorer!".

You should see your published message appear in the subscription panel of the same client (if subscribed to that topic) or in a different client connected to the same broker.

### 3. Using a Web-Based MQTT Client (MQTT over WebSockets)

Since your `docker-compose.yml` exposes port `9001` for WebSockets, you can use a web-based client:

* **MQTTX Web:** A popular browser-based MQTT client.

**Steps for a Web-Based Client:**

1.  **Open the Web Client:** Go to a website like `https://mqttx.app/web` or search for "online MQTT client."
2.  **Configure Connection:**
    * **Protocol:** Select `WebSocket` (or `ws://`).
    * **Host:** `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`)
    * **Port:** `9001`
    * **Path:** Often `/mqtt` is required by some brokers, but for Mosquitto's default WebSocket listener, it's usually not necessary unless explicitly configured in `mosquitto.conf`. Try without a path first.
3.  **Connect:** Click the connect button.
4.  **Subscribe and Publish:** Similar to desktop clients, subscribe to a topic and publish messages.

### 4. Simple Python Script (Paho MQTT Client)

This is great for programmatic testing and automation.

First, install the Paho MQTT client library:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
```

**a) Subscriber Script (`subscriber.py`):**

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print(f"Connected with result code {rc}")
    client.subscribe("test/python")

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"Received message on topic '{msg.topic}': {msg.payload.decode()}")

client = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2)
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Connect to the Mosquitto broker running on your host machine
# which is mapped to port 1883 of the container
client.connect("localhost", 1883, 60)

# Loop forever to process network traffic, dispatch callbacks, and handle reconnects
client.loop_forever()
```

**b) Publisher Script (`publisher.py`):**

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print(f"Connected with result code {rc}")

client = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2)
client.on_connect = on_connect

# Connect to the Mosquitto broker running on your host machine
# which is mapped to port 1883 of the container
client.connect("localhost", 1883, 60)
client.loop_start() # Start a non-blocking loop in a separate thread

try:
    for i in range(5):
        message = f"Python message {i}"
        client.publish("test/python", message)
        print(f"Published: '{message}' to 'test/python'")
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Exiting publisher.")
finally:
    client.loop_stop()
    client.disconnect()
```

**To run these scripts:**

1.  Open one terminal and run: `python subscriber.py`
2.  Open another terminal and run: `python publisher.py`

You should see the messages from the publisher script appearing in the subscriber script's terminal.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

* **Firewall:** Ensure your firewall isn't blocking ports `1883` or `9001` on your host machine.
* **`mosquitto.conf`:** Double-check your `mosquitto.conf` file. If you've added `allow_anonymous false`, you'll need to provide a username and password (and possibly set up an `aclfile` for topic permissions). For initial testing, `allow_anonymous true` is often used.
* **Docker Logs:** Check the logs of your Mosquitto container for any errors:
    ```bash
    docker logs mqtt5
    ```
* **Network Issues:** If you're having trouble connecting, ensure your client is trying to connect to `localhost` and the correct port, as these are the ports exposed by Docker on your host machine.

By using a combination of these testing methods, you can effectively verify that your Mosquitto MQTT broker is running correctly and that clients can publish and subscribe to messages.
