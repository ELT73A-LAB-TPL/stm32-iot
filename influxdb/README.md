This `docker-compose.yml` file sets up an **InfluxDB 2.x time-series database** within a Docker environment. Let's break down each section:

---

### Services

* `influxdb2:`: This defines a service named `influxdb2`.

    * `image: influxdb:alpine`: Specifies that the service will use the `influxdb` image with the `alpine` tag. Alpine images are known for being lightweight.
    * `container_name: influxdb2`: Assigns a fixed name `influxdb2` to the container. This makes it easy to reference the container in Docker commands and allows other services on the `iot-network` to find it by this name.
    * `ports:`
        * `- "8086:8086"`: Maps port `8086` on your host machine to port `8086` inside the `influxdb2` container. This is the **default port for InfluxDB's UI, API, and client connections**.
    * `environment:`: These variables are used to **initialize InfluxDB** during its first startup.

        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup`: Tells InfluxDB to run in setup mode on its first boot, which automatically creates the initial organization, user, bucket, and token.
        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=${INFLUXDB_USERNAME:-myusername}`: Sets the initial **administrator username**. It attempts to use the `INFLUXDB_USERNAME` environment variable from your host, defaulting to `myusername` if not set.
        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=${INFLUXDB_PASSWORD:-mypassword}`: Sets the initial **administrator password**. It uses `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD` from your host, defaulting to `mypassword`.
        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=${INFLUXDB_TOKEN:-mytoken}`: Sets the initial **administrator API token**. It uses `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` from your host, defaulting to `mytoken`. **It's crucial to change these default values for production!**
        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=IoT`: Defines the **initial organization name** as `IoT`.
        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=Node-RED`: Defines the **initial bucket name** as `Node-RED`. This is where your time-series data will be stored.
        * `- DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_RETENTION=1w`: Sets the **default data retention policy** for the initial bucket to `1 week` (`1w`). Data older than one week will be automatically deleted.
    * `volumes:`
        * `- influxdb2-data:/var/lib/influxdb2`: Mounts a named Docker volume `influxdb2-data` to `/var/lib/influxdb2` inside the container. This is the **primary location where InfluxDB stores all its data**, including databases, configurations, and metadata. Using a volume ensures your data persists even if the container is removed or recreated.
        * `- influxdb2-config:/etc/influxdb2`: Mounts another named Docker volume `influxdb2-config` to `/etc/influxdb2`. This directory can be used to store **InfluxDB configuration files** if you need to customize advanced settings beyond environment variables.
    * `networks:`
        * `- iot-network`: Connects the `influxdb2` service to the custom `iot-network`. This allows other services on this network (like your MQTT broker or Node-RED instance) to communicate with InfluxDB by its service name (`influxdb2`).
    * `restart: unless-stopped`: Configures the container to **automatically restart** unless it is explicitly stopped. This ensures the database remains available after host reboots or unexpected shutdowns.

---

### Volumes

* `influxdb2-data:`: Declares a named Docker volume for persistent InfluxDB data.
* `influxdb2-config:`: Declares a named Docker volume for InfluxDB configuration files.

    *Using **named volumes** is highly recommended for database containers as it guarantees that your precious data and specific configurations are not lost if the container is removed or updated.*

---

### Networks

* `iot-network:`: Declares a custom Docker network.
    * `driver: bridge`: Specifies the default `bridge` driver, creating an isolated network for inter-container communication.

---

### In Summary

This `docker-compose.yml` provides a streamlined way to deploy a **fully initialized InfluxDB 2.x instance** with persistence and network connectivity. It's perfectly set up for an IoT data collection scenario, especially given the `IoT` organization and `Node-RED` bucket names. The use of environment variables for initial setup makes it very convenient for getting started quickly, though you'll want to secure these credentials properly for any production deployment.

This setup is ideal for:
* Collecting **time-series data** from various IoT devices or applications.
* Integrating with **Node-RED** to ingest data into the `Node-RED` bucket.
* Visualizing data using **InfluxDB's built-in UI** or other dashboarding tools like Grafana.

### influx CLI demo

These commands should help you get your InfluxDB instance configured.

1.  Listing running Docker containers (`docker ps`).
2.  Accessing the `influxdb2` container's bash shell (`docker exec -it influxdb2 bash`).
3.  Creating an organization named "orgA".
4.  Creating a user "orgA" within "orgA" organization.
5.  Creating six buckets (bucket-A to bucket-F) under "orgA" organization.
6.  Creating an all-access authorization token for the "orgA" user.

```bash
docker ps
docker exec -it influxdb2 bash

influx org create --name orgA --description orgA
influx user create --org orgA --name orgA --password orgA
for group in A B C D E F; do
  influx bucket create --name bucket-${group} --org orgA
done

influx auth create --org orgA --user orgA --all-access
```
