InfluxDB 3 Core, as configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file, is primarily the data engine and does not include a built-in graphical user interface (UI) like InfluxDB 2.x or InfluxDB Cloud.

If you are looking for a UI to interact with your InfluxDB instance, you would typically use:

* **InfluxDB Cloud:** The fully managed service that includes a comprehensive UI for data exploration, dashboards, and more.
* **InfluxDB OSS (Open Source Software):** Versions 2.x and later include a built-in UI.
* **Third-party tools:** Tools like Grafana are commonly used to visualize data from InfluxDB.

For InfluxDB 3 Core specifically, interactions are generally done via client libraries, APIs, or command-line tools.
